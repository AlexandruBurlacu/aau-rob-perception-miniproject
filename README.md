See the name and figure it out

We'll be working with Python 3.6. Make sure you have it installed. It is really important.

For the required tasks, check the _Projects_ tab, there you'll find them.

### Linux Setup
To get started, first make a virtual environment, like this: `virtualenv .venv -p python3.6`, then enter it like this: `source .venv/bin/activate`, and finally install the requirements, like this: `pip install -r requirments.txt`.

### Windows Setup
Idk, similar, just Google how to make and use a virtual environmnet in Windows. Oh, you can also try using the Windows Ubuntu subsystem, might work.
